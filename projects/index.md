### computer science:

disclaimer: due to my university's academic policy, i am not allowed to
publicly host code that i have written for my courses. if you'd like to learn
more about some of the projects mentioned here, please get in touch and i'll
see what i can do!
<br><br>
these were some of my favorite projects to work on:

* chirc, an IRC server.  
* chitcp, a userspace implementation of tcp written. i grew to love [rfc793](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc793) 
* chirouter, an ip router capable of routing ipv4 datagrams. uses ARP and ICMP. 
* paxos consensus algorithm
* raft consensus algorithm (it really *was* easier!)

<br>

i still think that [this
paper](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/pubs/solved-and-unsolved.pdf)
is one of the best things ever. added bonus: in it, leslie lamport bridges
harmonizes computer science and philosophy (see the first complete paragraph on
pp. 4). now i have a pretty good answer whenever someone asks how i reconcile
the two.

### philosophy, etc. 

aside from my computer science coursework, i've also written quite a few papers
for philosophy and art history courses. a sampling:

* a review of the curatorial strategy of a mexican-american art museum in chicago, il
* a critique of the apparent power dynamics in participatory and performance art
* an analysis of a various theories of modality and how they apply to rule exceptions and moral dilemmas
