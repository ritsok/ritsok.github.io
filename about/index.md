Hi there! I'm Margarita (yes, Rita is fine too). I'm a student and a software engineer. I'm currently interested in Japanese aesthetics, apricots, and infrastructure work opportunities. I'd love to talk about any and all of these with you.

# Okay, tell me a little more 
I study philosophy and a smattering of computer science at the University of Chicago. My professional experience is a bit of a potpourri - I've worked with the platform team at [Braintree](http://braintreepayments.com) and as a shopgirl at a flower shop. I am also fiercely committed to the fight for gender parity in tech and have worked in the capacities of organizational leadership, classroom instruction, and curriculum development for various early education programs.

Yes! You can find a few links [here](/etc)
